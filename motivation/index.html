<p>What is Online Education? <em>Online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the internet for teacher and student interaction and the distribution of class material.</em> Online education is changing the face of traditional classroom and making education more accessible than ever before. With online education, student can turn anywhere with internet access and electricity into classroom. It can include audio, video, text, animation, virtual training environments and live chats with teachers. Many platform can be used for online education such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Google Classroom, Google Meet and Zoom. There were many motivation factors towards online education for me during covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>#1 Time Management</h2>

<p>Firstly, the factor that motivate me towards online education is about <strong>time management</strong>. I can manage my online education schedule with ease because it was so flexible. I do not have to prepare myself with formal attire that I normally wore in traditional classes. So, it can save my time. I also do not have to rush to classes because I just need to open my phone or laptop and books during the classes to listen what my lecturers teach. In <strong>time management</strong>, I know how to manage my time wisely and properly. <q>Time is precious, so waste it wisely</q></p>

<h2>#2 Online Learning Environment</h2>

<p>Next, the <strong>environment</strong> also motivate me towards online education. When at home, I felt enthusiastic to study because I am with my beloved family. My family always gives me moral support when I study at home. Moreover, they never disturb me when I attending online classes all doing my assignment. It is because my family does not want to give me any pressure that can lead to stress. My family know, anything that can stress me out will possible lead me to failure. It is a fact that learning process can be held anywhere and anytime. I know, it was so hard study at home because my friends also complaining about it.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from eLearningINDUSTRY's website</p>
<blockquote cite="https://elearningindustry.com/6-important-components-successful-online-learning-environment"> What makes you a good instructor in the classroom â€“ does not necessarily translate to good pedagogy in an online learning environment. Online Learning Environments are becoming increasingly available for learners in all areas of education from primary grades right through to higher education. They require key considerations to be cultivated to promote success.</blockquote>


<h2>#3 Interest</h2>

<p>Last but not least, my <strong>interest</strong> is the most important thing that motivate me towards online education. I really love the course that I am study right now. I have always wanted to study Office System since high school. I really passionate when it comes to office things. I think Office System is the most enjoyable and fun course. Besides, I do not have any problem when study office System through online education. Nothing can stop me from gaining knowledge because I am predator, and knowledge is my prey. I know learning is a constant process of discovering - a process without end. So, I will never stop learning till my last breathe. </p>

Online education also help the faculty to save much time in which they can interact with the students more.
